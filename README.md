# Source_custom component for McStas

The Source_custom [McStas](https://www.mcstas.org/) component is a flexible pulsed or continuous neutron source for your Monte Carlo simulations.
Stable versions are available in McStas as a [contributed component](https://www.mcstas.org/download/components/contrib/Source_custom.html).

The user documentation is embedded in the [Source_component.comp](Source_custom.comp) file,
and is also available in the [McStas components documentation](https://www.mcstas.org/download/components/).

A comprehensive description of the model can be found in the [Jupyter notebook](Source_custom_model.ipynb),
along with spectra fitting utilities to fine-tune your custom neutron source.

Please feel free to contact me with questions or ideas to improve this component :D
