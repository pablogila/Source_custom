# Source_custom component for McStas

The Source_custom [McStas](https://www.mcstas.org/) component is a flexible pulsed or continuous neutron source for your Monte Carlo simulations.
Stable versions are available in McStas as a contributed component.

The user documentation is embedded in the [Source_component](Source_custom.comp) file.
A comprehensive description of the model is available in the [Jupyter notebook](Source_custom_model.ipynb), along with spectra fitting utilities to fine-tune your custom neutron source.

Please feel free to contact me with questions or ideas to improve this component :D
